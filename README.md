## Doridot sncell

This repository is used to host the (in progress) sncell base that the Doridot team will use for their snCell analysis.
This will be a snakemake pipeline, taking in data already aligned (in general via CellRanger, eventhough sme other options may be implementd with time) and hendling demultiplexing, creation of an general Seurat object, and the classical steps of sncell analysis.
As those steps have to be experimented with, we encourage users to personnalise the config file. A How To for each steps of the process will be created as well.
Currently being worked on by Alix and Kheira
